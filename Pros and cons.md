Pros
----

- Built from very simple components
- Simple components allow for easy implementation in hard ware
- Simple components make the algorithm quick in both hardware and software
- Works as a drop in replacement of SHA2
- "the best attacks on Gr√∏stl, JH, and Skein would require huge computational resources to implement, and cannot be fully verified"
-"Keccak has the largest security margin, with 79% of its hash function still unbroken; JH has the smallest security margin, with 38% unbroken"

Cons
----

- MAC is not the greatest in terms of efficiency
	- Push for dedicated MAC protocol in place of using hashing functions for MACs
