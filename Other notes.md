- For the purpose of the SHA-3 decision, these results can be summarized as follows:
	a. All five finalists have indifferentiability proofs, which guarantee that the hash function resists generic attacks up to at least the complexity of a brute-force collision search, assuming that the underlying primitive is ideal.
	b. Under the same assumption, all of the candidates except JH are proven to have near-optimal security relating to the core properties of collision, preimage, and second-preimage resistance. Even in the case of JH, the indifferentiability proof guarantees some generic security for these properties (the optimal security, in the case of collision search), and there is no known way for an attacker to exploit the JH domain extension to find preimages, or second preimages more efficiently than a brute-force search
