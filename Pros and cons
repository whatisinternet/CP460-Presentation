Pros
----

- Built from very simple components
- Simple components allow for easy implementation in hard ware
- Simple components make the algorithm quick in both hardware and software
- Works as a drop in replacement of SHA2


Cons
----

- MAC is not the greatest in terms of efficiency
	- Push for dedicated MAC protocol in place of using hashing functions for MACs
